        { "content": "To keep customers from having to line up to get their order, Dunkin’ Donuts launched an On-the-Go app. And to promote its speed, we produced The World’s Fastest Dunkin’ Run, which saw Ellen Brennan, the world’s fastest flying woman, order on her app, then jump from 8,300 feet, and flying at 120 mph, swoop down to grab her order in mid-flight. Content was launched in multiple platforms, including a 360/VR experience, so viewers could fly right alongside Ellen." },
        { "content": "The video got over 7 million views in just the first two weeks, helping to gain Dunkin' a 44% increase in new app users, making this launch Dunkin's most successful operational change in over 30 years. The campaign also saw Ellen became the first person to ever successfully pick up an object during a wing suit flight. And the Dunkin’ video became the most watched 360 extreme sports video ever." }
